## Introduction

The AI Maturity Assessment is a tool designed to help organizations understand their current AI maturity level across three key dimensions:

1. **Productivity Enhancement**: How effectively your organization is using AI to improve internal processes and efficiency.
2. **Value Creation**: How your organization is leveraging AI to enhance products, services, and customer experiences.
3. **Business Model Innovation**: How AI is influencing your overall business strategy and creating new opportunities.

The assessment uses a four-level maturity model:

- **Level 1: Exploring** - Initial awareness and exploration of AI capabilities
- **Level 2: Experimenting** - Active experimentation with AI solutions in limited contexts
- **Level 3: Implementing** - Systematic implementation of AI across multiple business areas
- **Level 4: Transforming** - AI as a core element of business strategy and operations

3. You'll be guided through a series of questions about your organization's AI practices

## Assessment Process

The assessment follows a conversational format with these stages:

### 1. User Information

First, you'll be asked some basic information about yourself and your organization:
- Your name and role

### 3. Completion

After answering the questions (typically 10-15 minutes total):

For a more natural experience, you can use voice input:

1. Click the microphone icon during the assessment
