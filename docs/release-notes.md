## Audio Playback Flow Fix

This commit addresses issues with the audio playback in the AI Maturity Assessment app:

### Problems Fixed:
- Fixed the overlapping audio where multiple instances of the same sentence would play simultaneously
- Fixed the button state not changing from "Audio playing... Please wait" after audio playback completion
- Prevented duplicate voice playback after the first sentence
- Improved audio resource management to prevent memory leaks

### Key Changes:
- Added proper tracking of audio playback state
- Added refs to track active AudioContext and sources
- Implemented a dedicated stopAudio function
- Added playedMessage tracking to prevent duplicate playback
- Improved event handling with proper cleanup

These changes result in a smoother, more reliable voice interaction flow that plays audio only once per message and properly transitions between states.
